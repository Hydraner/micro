Micro Module for D8.
Micro entities are some really slim entities with no fields.

How to use it
=============

After installing the module you can go to "admin/structure/micro" and add some additional micro types (similar to node types).

Once done, you can add new micro entities at "micro/add", and list them at "admin/content/micro".
